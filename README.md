The data is the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

After downloading and unzipping the data into your working directory, and the plot.R files, you can use them with the following lines:

source("plot1.R");
plot1();

source("plot2.R");
plot2();

etc.
